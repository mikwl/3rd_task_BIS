I would like to divide my answer into two parts:

- Why i prefered Python for starting in programming?
- Why did I finally chose Python? 

Python is a modern and rather common programming language. 
Although Python isn't perfect for every application, using Python is a good choice in various situations. 
It can help to solve many programming problems as well as it's  the best way to learn programming. 
I can use Python for developing desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications. 
Also, Python, as a high level programming language, allows you to focus on core functionality of 
the application by taking care of common programming tasks. 

### Why do I prefer Python for my start in programming? My top reasons: 

**1. Itâ€™s easy to learn and use.** Types are associated with objects, not variables. 
Python typically operates at a much higher level of abstraction. Syntax rules are simple.

**2. Mature and Supportive Python Community. **This means that if somebody has an issue 
with python language, they can get instant support from developers of all levels ranging 
from beginner to expert in the community.

**3. Phylosophy of Python.** The idea is that when you install Python, it includes 
everything you need to do real work, without the need to install additional libraries. 
Libraries with specific focus are also available for your needs.

### Why did I finally choose Python? 

When I was a little boy, I first time saw film "Matrix". The film's heroes mentioned 
artificial intelligence. Then I became interested in computers, 
because they can think like people. 

I would say Python is often a good choice for small teams and new web developers. 
However, what the best language is depends on your individual needs. 
If you are just starting out you probably don't have enough knowledge to make a well informed choice. 
In that case just jump into something and try it out. Python is as good a place to start as any.
Python help me to realize my AI-code in future.

Only when I started studying Python I realized that the threshold 
of the entrance is extremely high. You should have an excellent knowledge 
of both the code and other higher sciences. However, it's interesting for me, 
so it means that studying will be much easier and more interesting, but it takes much more time.
